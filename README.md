# Bangluru_house_price_prediction

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This project predicts house prices in Bengaluru using machine learning models, served through a Flask API. The model is trained on real estate data and can be accessed via RESTful endpoints, making it easy to integrate into web applications or other systems.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites for model building</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn,Flask</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Once the Flask server is running, you can use the API to predict house prices by sending a POST request with the relevant data.</p>
  
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Predict house prices based on key features like location, size, and number of bedrooms.</li>
  <li>Data preprocessing and cleaning to handle missing values and outliers.</li>
  <li>Easily integrate the API with frontend applications or other services.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Model Details</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Algorithm: Linear Regression</li>
  <li>Dataset: The dataset includes features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and price.(Dataset is approx 5 year old)</li>
</ul>

<p>backend is connected to simple frontend build with html, css  and javascript</p>
